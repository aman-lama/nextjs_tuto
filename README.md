## [x] STEP 1: Creating a Router in Next.js:

> Rename your [your_url] folder with the link it redirects to. eg: "~/nori" would be Piyush. [case sensitive] You can do more research on different cases in folder architecture. eg: difference between (ayush) and ayush.

## [x] STEP 2: Create a Page.tsx file with layout.tsx

> (layout.tsx) file lets you statically load components in every subpages. Eg: Components like Header,Footer or Context may be included in layout.tsx

> You can start editing the page by modifying ~/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
