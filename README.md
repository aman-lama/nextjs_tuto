# Career Goals

I'm interested in **Data Science** because it's full of surprises. I don't always know what I'll discover, and that's what increases my curiosity. I love digging into data and finding insights that are not expected.

While I may not have a specific goal in mind, I am driven by a clear purpose: to leverage my skills in Data Science to make a meaningful impact. I aspire to collaborate with a forward-thinking organization, where I can contribute towards its growth and improvement through data-driven strategies and solutions.

# Planned Roadmap

My Planned RoadMap (Please advise if any of these are outdated or if there are emerging trends I should consider):

1. **Maths**: (statistics, probability, calculus)
2. **Programming Languages**: Python with core focus on basic libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib,etc) as well as ml libraries(sklearn, tensorflow,Keras,etc). Also been recently looking at frameworks like langchain for llm as well as R for its use in analytics.
3. **Databases**: at least one relational and one non relational.
4. **Big Data/ External Data Visualization tools** like Tableau, Excel, Hadoop, etc.
5. Learn **web scraping** to extract data from websites.

While it is not possible to integrate all these elements into a single project, this is just **my plan to outline the areas I aim to learn** in the future. I already have some familiarity with Python, SQL, sklearn, etc to some extent.

This will be hosted in Link `nextjs-tuto-virid.vercel.app`

`Do pull this new updates to your machines`

STEP 1:
Creating a Router in Next.js:

Rename your [your_url] folder with the link it redirects to. eg: "~/Piyush" would be Piyush. [case sensitive]
You can do more research on different cases in folder architecture. eg: difference between (ayush) and ayush.



STEP 2:
Create a Page.tsx file with layout.tsx

(layout.tsx) file lets you statically load components in every subpages. Eg: Components like Header,Footer or Context may be included in layout.tsx


You can start editing the page by modifying `~/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
