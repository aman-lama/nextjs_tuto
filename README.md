`Do pull this new updates to your machines`

STEP 1:
Creating a Router in Next.js:

Rename your [your_url] folder with the link it redirects to. eg: "~/Piyush" would be Piyush. [case sensitive]
You can do more research on different cases in folder architecture. eg: difference between (ayush) and ayush.

STEP 2:
Create a Page.tsx file with layout.tsx

(layout.tsx) file lets you statically load components in every subpages. Eg: Components like Header,Footer or Context may be included in layout.tsx

You can start editing the page by modifying `~/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
