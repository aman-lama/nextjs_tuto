I want to work in a field where I can analyze data to find valuable insights. At the same time, I'm interested in creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites. I'm drawn to the creative side of making websites look good and ensuring they're easy to use. To achieve this

Why Data Analysis?
I enjoy data analysis because it allows me to uncover meaningful patterns and insights from raw information, transforming it into valuable knowledge. One aspect I appreciate is its adaptability, as data analysis is applicable across various fields, from business and healthcare to marketing and sports. Hopefully, my skills in data analysis can help me enter the field of sports as it is  a combination of my interests. To achieve this, I plan to deepen my skills in tools like Python, Power BI, Tableau, SQL and spreadsheets.

Why Front-end?
Front-end web development appeals to me for several reasons. Firstly, I am drawn to the creative aspect of building visually engaging and user-friendly interfaces that enhance the overall user experience. Crafting websites that not only function well but also look appealing is a gratifying challenge. This includes UI/UX designing as well. My future goals in this field would be to increase my skills and capabilities so that I can create a much more appealing website and can actually bring my design ideas to reality. To be able to do that, I plan to learn various skills like NextJS, ThreeJS and also increase my current understanding of CSS, Bootstrap, HTML and JavaScropt as well.
